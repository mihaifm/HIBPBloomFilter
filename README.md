## HIBPBloomFilter

This is a [Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) for the [HIBP Offline Check](https://github.com/mihaifm/HIBPOfflineCheck) KeePass plugin.

This repository contains only the filter in binary format, the source code for generating it can be found in the [HIBPOfflineCheck](https://github.com/mihaifm/HIBPOfflineCheck) repository.
You can generate the filter from the plugin options in under one hour. On a modern system with a SSD this time can be reduced to under 15 minutes.

For convenience however, you can download the filter directly from this repository's releases.
